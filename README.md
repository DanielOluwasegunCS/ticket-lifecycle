I walked through this part as if I was an end-user/customer creating a ticket. This is the starting page for the osTicet support center.

I created a ticket as "Karen Karson" and used the help topic that I created as an admin in osTicket to describe a scenario that may occur in the real-world.

I walked through this part as if I was the cue/ticket manager. I reworked the ticket and changed the settings to match the help topic which was a Sev-A (emergency ticket). It was a ticket that needed to be worked on and solved immediately because in a real-world scenario it would negatively impact the whole business.

I wrote a message saying that the "issue" had been fixed and changed the ticket status from "open" to "resolved." This closed the ticket.
